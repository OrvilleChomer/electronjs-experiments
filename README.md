# Electron Experiments
Here I am going to add various little experimental programs using Electron (www.electronjs.org). Maybe you will find these samples useful yourself!

Some of this is going to be samples that are really nothing new... just me practicing!

Some experiments will be trying basic stuff... but a little differently than I've seen... mainly practicing again to come up with sample code that I can possibly find useful in my own projects.

I am doing my development on a Mac.  The editor I am using is VS Code.

You might find some of the content here over-obvious... Wellll... *Captain Obvious Strikes Again!*

## Contents
- Setting up an Electron Environment on your Desktop Computer
- [Creating a new Electron Project](creating-electron-projects.MD)
- Running/Testing Your Project -- in your projects directory type in the command:  `npm start`

- Proposed Experiments:
   - [ ] Project #1: A simple App with a Window
   - [ ] Project #2: App window code (renderer.js) Sending Messages to main.js
   - [ ] Project #3: Same as #2 but it sends a response back to the window code
   - [ ] Project #n: Modify a window's menu
   - [ ] Project #n: Context menu
   - [ ] Project #n: Open Dialog. Allow user to select a text file and view its contents
   - [ ] Project #n: Edit and Save text files... use Save Dialog
   - [ ] Project #4: main.js code sends a message window code (renderer.js)
   - [ ] Project #n: Load and Parse a JSON file (from file system)
   - [ ] Project #n: Load and Parse an XML file (from file system)
   - [ ] Project #n: Connect to mySQL database, get Schema information, and display it in window
   - [ ] Project #n: Same as #n but for a SQL Server database
   - [ ] Project #n: Same as #n but for an Oracle Database
   - [ ] Project #n: FTP: Connect, Change Path, Upload, and Download
