# Electron Experiments
Here I am going to add various little experimental programs using Electron (www.electronjs.org). Maybe you will find these samples useful yourself!

Some of this is going to be samples that are really nothing new... just me practicing!

Some experiments will be trying basic stuff... but a little differently than I've seen... mainly practicing again to come up with sample code that I can possibly find useful in my own projects.

I am doing my development on a Mac.  The editor I am using is VS Code.

You might find some of the content here over-obvious... Wellll... *Captain Obvious Strikes Again!*

- Running/Testing Your Project -- in your projects directory type in the command:  `npm start`

- The Experiments:
   - Project #1: A simple App with a Window
   - Project #2: App window code (renderer.js) Sending Messages to main.js
   - Project #3: Same as #2 but it sends a response back to the window code
   - Project #n: Modify a window's menu
   - Project #n: Button on window brings up an open dialog
   - Project #4: main.js code sends a message window code (renderer.js)
   - Project #5: Connect to mySQL database, get Schema information, and display it in window
   - Project #6: Same as #5 but for a SQL Server database
   - Project #7: Same as #5 but for an Oracle Database
