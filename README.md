# Electron Experiments
Here I am going to add various little experimental programs using Electron (www.electronjs.org). Maybe you will find these samples useful yourself!

Some of this is going to be samples that are really nothing new... just me practicing!

Some experiments will be trying basic stuff... but a little differently than I've seen... mainly practicing again to come up with sample code that I can possibly find useful in my own projects.

I am doing my development on a Mac.  The editor I am using is VS Code.

You might find some of the content here over-obvious... Wellll... *Captain Obvious Strikes Again!*

#### Setting up an Electron Environment:
In order to use Electron, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. 

#### Setting up an Electron Project:
I am using the common method of using the command line interface to do this (CLI)... Don't assume though that this is the only way that this can be done. Anyways, the steps:
- Create a directory for your project in a place that makes sense... this is where the code for your project is going to reside.
- From the command line, make sure you change directory to that new directory... it becomes your *working directory*.
