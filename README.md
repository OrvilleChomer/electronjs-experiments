# Electron Experiments
Here I am going to add various little experimental programs using Electron (www.electronjs.org). Maybe you will find these samples useful yourself!

Some of this is going to be samples that are really nothing new... just me practicing!

Some experiments will be trying basic stuff... but a little differently than I've seen... mainly practicing again to come up with sample code that I can possibly find useful in my own projects.

I am doing my development on a Mac.  The editor I am using is VS Code.

You might find some of the content here over-obvious... Wellll... *Captain Obvious Strikes Again!*
