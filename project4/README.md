# Project 4: Dynamically Generate HTML Code and Display in Window

### This project demonstrates:
- Using the file system to generate an HTML file
- How the HTML file content can be automatically generated based on various states such as the environment the app running in
- Opening up this new HTML file in a window
- Also demonstrates opening up a link url in a web browser

### Project Setup
- You will need to have Node.js already installed on your computer
- Create a folder on your computer where you want this project to reside
- Copy the files in this Github Repo folder into your new folder
- You will notice at this point that in this repo folder there is no **node_modules** folder yet
- From the command line:
  - Make sure you change directory to your new folder  `cd {your new folder's path}`
  - Type in the command: `npm install --save-dev electron` This will create a **node_modules** folder and add the Electron related files to it
  - This could take a little bit of time to run!
  - Once done, you are ready to run the project!  just type in the command: `npm start` !
